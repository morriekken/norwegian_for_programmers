# Norwegian for programmers

Formal grammar for Norwegian using a structure similar to Backus-Naur Form (BNF) or Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).

**I used ChatGPT to help with definitions, and I was able to verify rules with [Norwegian Anatomy (polish)](https://www.anatomianorweskiego.com/). This information was not quality checked with any norwegian language teacher.**
